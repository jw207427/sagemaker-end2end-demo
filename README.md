## We will use Fraud Detection for Automobile Claims use case to demo following SageMaker functions

Auto insurance fraud ranges from misrepresenting facts on insurance applications and inflating insurance claims to staging accidents and submitting claim forms for injuries or damage that never occurred, to false reports of stolen vehicles. Fraud accounted for between 15 percent and 17 percent of total claims payments for auto insurance bodily injury in 2012, according to an Insurance Research Council (IRC) study. The study estimated that between $5.6 billion and $7.7 billion was fraudulently added to paid claims for auto insurance bodily injury payments in 2012, compared with a range of $4.3 billion to $5.8 billion in 2002.
